    <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>
      Actively using <em>(Kotlin, Java), (ECMAScript 5/6/7, Typescript).</em> I also program in <em>(Python),
      (Ruby)</em> and have interest in <em>(Go-Lang), (Er-Lang), (Haskell)</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <p>
      Actively using <em>(Spring on Java / Kotlin / Scala), (Koa.js / Express on Node), (Angular / React on
      Web). </em> I have keen interest in modern web front-end frameworks and technologies like web-components,
      shadow-DOM etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Actively using <em>Linux</em> containerized manifestations <em>(Docker), (PCF), (BlueMix)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been early adopter of <em>(Docker)</em> and have used it for production as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>I have keen interest in Machine Learning. So far, I have learnt to build and use models in <em>(TensorFlow)</em>.
      I would love to contribute professionally in Machine Learning. Most of my ML experience has been DIY.
    </p>

    <h2>Windows or Mac</h2>
    <p>
      I need bash, can't work with power-shell, but I am a Windows 10 user. Git-bash has long been a saviour.
      Especially after Windows 10 pro came up with Linux subsystem, haven't found any motivation to switch.
      Also, there are plenty of great windows laptops, many more power and some even slicker that Mac-Books
